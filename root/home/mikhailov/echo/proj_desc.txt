Project Name: Echo
Version: 0.1 Alpha
Date Initiated: Jan 15, 1991

Description:
This is an experiment to
create a thinking machine
using DemoStar OS and Z80 CPU
by Dr. Mikhailov. It started
as curiosity but grew into
something bigger.

Goals:
To simulate basic human-like
thoughts. To teach it learn.
To make it talk back. Maybe
even give it a personality.

Hardware:
Processor: Z80
RAM: 64 KB
Storage: 2 MB floppy disk

Software:
OS: DemoStar v3.2
Language: Assembly
Libraries: Math & Neural

Challenges:
Limited memory. Slow speeds.
But we push forward. Science
never stops. Even on old
hardware. That's the spirit!

Status:
As of Dec 1, 1991
We have a brain that thinks.
Not much yet, but it's start.
Next? Who knows...
